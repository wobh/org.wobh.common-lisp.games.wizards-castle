#+description: Common Lisp implementation of Joseph Power's classic game.
#+keywords:
#+startup: overview

* Introduction

From the "Final instructions" section of the article introducing
_Wizard's Castle_ (Power 1980):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
These instructions are meant to be a guide only. Feel free to
experiment with the various responses when running the game (this is
have the fun of the game). For the best results use equal parts
imagination and common sense.
#+END_QUOTE

I first took these words as license to tinker with the source code and
make the game say and do different things. But, now that I type them
out, it seems more like Power was actually encouraging players to
experiment in order to figure out how to play the game.

_Wizard's Castle_ is a little too primitive to offer the kind of
combinatorial possibilities of play that a game like _Nethack_ offers,
but there is potential. This implementation is done to fulfill the
following goals:

- Faithfully play it as originally coded.
- Provide the options to play the Commodore PET and MSDOS versions of
  the game.
- Make it easy to expand the game's scope of play and to offer some
  minor fixes and improvements.

I have consulted the original article, as well as source code for the
other editions of the game.

* Instructions

To use:

1. Clone repository
2. Run =make install= this will install it into
   ~${XDG_DATA_HOME}/common-lisp/source/org.wobh.common-lisp.games.wizards-castle~
3. in REPL =(require "asdf")= (as needed)
4. =(require "org.wobh.common-lisp.games.wizards-castle")=
5. =(wizards-castle:play)=

If you wish to experiment, or for play-testing:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CL-USER> (in-package #:wizard)
WIZARD>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Right now, running a test game is just like running a regular game
with a few shortcuts to skip the castle and adventurer setup phases.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
WIZARD> (setup-test)
[... output elided ...]
WIZARD (play-test)
#+END_EXAMPLE

See the section "Testing symbols and functions" for more information
about these functions.

NOTE: ~zot~ is one of the nicknames of the package, and you may see
that instead of ~wizard~ in these examples.

* Exported symbols, functions and their options

** ~play~

~play~ plays the game with defaults to the game as originally
coded. The following keyword options to ~play~ are available:

*** ~:adventurer (or adventurer-object nil)~

Provide an adventurer object to the play functions. This bypasses the
adventurer setup phase. Use the ~make-adventurer~ function to create a
custom adventurer. The ~make-test-adv~ function will create a few
pre-made adventurer characters.

*** ~:castle (or castle-object nil)~

Provide a castle object for the main adventure. This bypasses the
castle setup phase. If the castle object already has a
~cas-adventurer~ object defined, the game will use that, if not, the
game will proceed with the adventurer setup.

** ~play-ohare~

Play the Commodore PET game as adapted by John O'Hare.

The curse notice text is bound to ~*curse-notice-ohare*~.

I have not yet figured out how to format the output for the shorter
line length in this edition.

** ~play-stetson~

Play the MSDOS game as adapted by J.T. Stetson.

** New features

*** ~*forgetfulness* (or symbol nil)~

By default, to conform to original code, ~*forgetfulness*~ is set to
~:random~ which unmaps a random room in the castle, regardless of
whether it was mapped or not. Set ~*forgetfulness*~ to ~:mapped~
and it will forget a room that has already been mapped.

*** ~*gaze-mapper* (or symbol nil)~

Gazing into orbs can give information about other rooms in the castle,
but this information isn't reflected in the map, because what the orbs
say isn't always true.

Setting ~*gaze-mapper*~ to ~:naive~ will cause let the
adventurer to map the rooms that the orbs inform about, even if the
information is untrue, even if .

Setting ~*gaze-mapper*~ to ~:ask~ will cause the game to ask the
player if it should map the creature at the coordinates specified.

*** ~*wiz-format*~

The format string used by ~wiz-format~. By default, this is set to
~*all-caps*~. You can set it to ~*mixed-case*~ when you want less
obnoxious output strings.

*** ~*wiz-coords*~

Common Lisp's array subscripts have to be translated into the system
used for the orginal game. By default this is set to ~:wizard~ and so
coordinate will be translated. When set to ~:array~ the game uses
array coordinates.

** Testing symbols and functions

*** ~*r*~

A special variable holding a reusable random-state. Used by the
testing environment to recreate castle objects and replay
games. Default value is a new random state from ~(make-random-state
t)~.

*** ~*a*~

An adventurer object for testing. Default value, ~nil~. Use
~make-test-adv~ to create a test adventurer.

*** ~*z*~

A castle object for testing. Default value, ~nil~. Instead of making
deep copies of the testing environment's castle object, the testing
environment reuses the random state ~*r*~ to regenerate it.


*** ~make-test-adv (symbol)~

Make a test adventurer object from a predefined set. Accepts one
keyword symbol argument.

**** ~adv-name~

The set of predefined adventurers is roughly as follows:

- ~:blind-adept~ :: A female human fighter: highly capable and
                    skilled, well armed and armored, but poor, blind.
- ~:bookworm~    :: A male hobbit: smart and fast (skilled in
                    running-away), but weak; poor, unarmed and
                    unarmored; has a book stuck to his hands.
- ~:valkyrie~    :: A female dwarf: strong, somewhat graceful and more
                    brave than smart; well armored but less well
                    armed, poor and poorly equipped.
- ~:barbarian~   :: A male human: strong, agile, but dumb and
                    forgetful; well-armed, but poorly armored; poor
                    and poorly equipped.
- ~:sorceress~   :: A female elf: highly intelligent, somewhat
                    graceful but weak; no money, poorly armed and
                    armored; has many flares, and the runestaff but
                    lazy and lethargic.
- ~:tourist~     :: A human male: moderate iq, but weak and clumsy;
                    unarmed, unarmored, no equipment; extremely rich,
                    but has hole in his wallet (leech).
- ~:basic~       :: A human with randomly selected sex: average
                    abilities and equipment; poor but at least owns a
                    lamp. This is the character I would always make in
                    the character setup phase.

See the source code for their exact specifications.
*** ~setup-test~

Sets up ~*a*~ and ~*z*~ using a copy of ~*r*~ for the random state in
making ~*z*~ and ~make-test-adv~ for ~*a*~. After this is run, ~*a*~
and ~*z*~ may be passed or ~main~ or used in ~test~ for playing.

*** ~map-all-rooms~

Maps all the rooms in a given castle. Of course, ~cas-adventurer~ must
be defined.

*** ~play-test~

Play a testing game with a resuable random-state. The equivalent of
the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(let ((*random-state* (make-random-state *r*)))
  (main :adventurer *a* :castle *z* :last-castle t))
#+END_EXAMPLE

* [0/3] Future work
** TODO setup package ~wizards-castle-test~

Extract the tests from the main file to their own package.

** TODO setup package ~wizards-castle-user~

Extract playtesting features from the main file to their own package.

** TODO setup parameter ~*texts*~ and support ~get-text~ features

Make it possible to customize game messaging.
